SATYANARAYANA MURTHY 1 2004SCC 769.
JUSTICE M.
Applying the said principle to the facts of the present case I find that the action of respondent No.1 in interfering with the possession and enjoyment of the petitioners over the subject property is illegal and arbitrary.
Therefore I am of the view that it is expedient to decide both these petitions by common order.
Respondent No.3 herein filed O.S.No.111 against her family members and others for partition of the land.
Petitioner s father purchased the said land under Registered Sale Deed bearing Doc.No.1905 2009 from Chennakcsavula Rambabu and Thota Paideshwar Rao.
