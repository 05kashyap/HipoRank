The said orders are set aside and the order of the trial court is restored.” In view of the aforesaid reasoning this Court is not inclined to interfere in the writ petition.

Since the facts of this case do not make out any extraordinary ground for permitting the respondent to put up construction and alienate the same we think both the courts below namely the lower appellate court and the High Court erred in making the impugned orders.
In the event of the appellant s claim being found baseless ultimately it is always open to the respondent to claim damages or in an appropriate case the court may itself award damages for the loss suffered if any in this regard.
