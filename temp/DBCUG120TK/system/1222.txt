IN THE CRIMINAL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.305 OF 2013 Arising out of S.L.P.No.
150712 wherein the High Court has declined to quash the FIR No.
But to say that it is a second FIR relating to the same cause of action and the same incident and there is sameness of occurrence and an attempt has been made to improvise the case is not correct.
Radhakrishnan [Dipak Misra New Delhi February 14 2013.
The appellants or any of the other complainants or the accused persons may move the appropriate court for a trial in one court.
Hence we conclude and hold that the submission that the FIR lodged by the fourth respondent is a second FIR and is therefore liable to be quashed does not merit acceptance In view of the aforesaid premised reasons the appeal being sans substance stands dismissed K.
