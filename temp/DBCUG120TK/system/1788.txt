Therefore as such both the courts below have rightly not permitted the plaintiff to rely upon the documents other than the invoices as additional documents in exercise of the powers under Order XI Rule 1read with Order XI Rule 1403.2017.
There was sufficient time gap between the filing of the first suit and filing of the second suit i.e.
Defendant Through Mr.Sanjeev Sindhwani Sr.Adv.
And therefore as such Order XI Rule 1 shall not be applicable though the application was filed within thirty days of filing of the second suit.
IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI Judgment Reserved on: 08.03.2021 Judgment Pronounced on: 09.11.2021 CS(COMM) 403 2017 SHRI RISHI RAJ Plaintiff Through Mr.Harish Malhotra Sr.Adv.
with Mr.Rajender Agarwal Adv.
Therefore the case on behalf of the plaintiff that when the second suit was filed it was urgently filed therefore the additional documents sought to be relied upon other than the invoices were not filed as the same were voluminous cannot be accepted.
