ARC has rightly observed that the tenancy could not have been created in favour of a minor as respondent no.2 appellant was not competent to enter into a contract.

As a matter of fact there is no challenge to the testimony of petitioner landlord that the premises was let out at the monthly rent of CM(M) 458 2020 Rs.
Moreover it has also come in evidence that father of respondent no.2 appellant had gone abroad as per the passport shown during the trial on 07.06.1981 probably after handing over the exclusive possession of the tenancy premises in favour of his son respondent 458 2020 that warrants interference by this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
