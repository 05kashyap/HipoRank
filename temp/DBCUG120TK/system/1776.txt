Therefore the order of the learned Magistrate imposing condition No.6 cannot be said to be unreasonable illegal or unjustified.
Therefore the petition filed is found to be devoid of merits and thus is liable to be dismissed.
Accordingly the present petition dismissed.
Civil Judge & JMFC II Bidar.
It is alleged against the petitioner that he had come to India on Tourist Visa but had violated 3 the conditions of Visa and thus committed the offence of violation of provisions of the FA Act.
Therefore such condition is imposed and ordering for putting the petitioner in a detention centre cannot be termed as negating the bail.
JUDGE Sd.
Civil Judge & JMFC II Bidar while granting bail in Crime No.58 2020 of Gandhi Gunj Police Station now culminated into C.C.No.708 2020.
Putting a foreign nationals who violates the law of the country after obtaining bail in a detention centre is different from putting them in a jail.
