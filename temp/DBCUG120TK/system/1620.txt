Judge.
Shri Justice S.A.Dharmadhikari Hon.
In the present case in the detailed enquiry it was found that no material physically transferred from Agra to W.A.No.1823 2019 In view whereof no fault can be found in the finding recorded by the learned Single Judge as well as learned appellate authority.
Brief facts leading to filing of the writ petition were that the appellant is a dealer registered under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act 2017and is engaged in carrying on the business of selling and purchasing of Clarified ButterButter and W.A.No.1823 2019 other milk products under the name of M s Om Trading Company Gwalior.
The learned Single Judge has rightly come to the conclusion and dismissed the writ petition The judgments relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant are of no assistance to the appellant inasmuch as the facts of those cases and the present case are altogether different.
