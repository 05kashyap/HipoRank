& ORS DATE OF JUDGMENT: 16 01 1996 1996 SCC 389 JT 1996658 1996 SCALE (1)SP36 Vs ATTAH KASIM & ORS RAMASWAMY K RAMASWAMY K G.B.
The case of the plaintiffs appears to be reasonable just and in the circumstances well founded.
However the appellate Court committed another error of not considering the documentary evidence in proper perspective of the respective claims of the parties Admittedly the plaintiffs and the first defendant are children of Ahmad Malmi through his first and second wives respectively.
The only claim was with regard to one item namely Konchukakkada property.
The plaintiffs recognise the rights of defendants 1 2 and 5 to claim their share in the property in accordance with their personal law.
Ex.A 3 is a crucial document in establishing the title of the plaintiffs in the property.
