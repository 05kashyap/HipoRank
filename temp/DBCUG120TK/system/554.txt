Consequently the appeal is allowed.
the Appellant made forcible physical relationship with her.
The evidence clearly establishes that there was her consent for the physical relationship for the long period of 3 years.
Since she was a major girl and was a consenting party the conviction under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code imposed upon the Appellant is not sustainable.
Therefore her statement that she consented for the physical relationship on a false promise of marriage is not acceptable.
