JUSTICE RAJBIR SEHRAWAT PRESENT : Mr.
Therefore the argument of learned counsel for the Insurance Company otherwise also is beyond the pleadings.
Hence the same cannot be accepted by this Court.In view of the above the findings of the Tribunal to the extent of the exclusion of the liablity of the InsuranceCompany and the consequent Award to that extent is set aside.It is ordered that the liablity to make the payment of the awardedamount shall be of the Insurance Company.
On the contrary in the writtenstatement the Insurance Company has taken the stand that theirliability is limited to the extent of Rs.50 000 only.
