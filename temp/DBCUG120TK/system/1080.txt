However we do not impose the extreme penalty which was chosen by the trial court.
Hence the respondent is sentenced to imprisonment for life under Section 302 of the IPC We direct the Sessions Judge Barabanki to take necessary steps to get the respondent back into custody if he is not already in jail.

SABHARWAL THOMAS J Whoever was the assailant it was a hatrick for him when three persons of the same house were slaughtered in one operation.
Hence we do so and restore the conviction passed by the trial court.
We have no other option but to interfere with the unmerited acquittal passed by the High Court.
If respondent was the assailant it was a case of patricide cum matricide cum fratricide.
So the task is heavy for the prosecution to carry conviction of the truth of the allegation against the respondent.
