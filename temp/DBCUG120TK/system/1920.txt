IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.
In view of the above conclusion we confirm the decision of the High Court.
It is well settled law that it is the duty of the court to respect the legislative intent and by giving liberal interpretation limitation cannot be extended by invoking the provisions of Section 5 of the Act.
Hence all the appeals are accordingly dismissed.
In other words the applicability of the provisions of the Limitation Act therefore to be judged not from the terms of the Limitation Act but by the provisions of the Central Excise Act relating to filing of reference application to the High Court.
The scheme of the Central Excise Act 1944 support the conclusion that the time limit prescribed under Section 35H(1) to make a reference to High Court is absolute and unextendable by court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.
