The respondent initially filed a writ petition5 challenging the termination of the PPA.
“AC No 15” “1996 Act” 2 Under the PPA the respondent was to establish a mini hydro electric project on a built and operate basis.
The High Court by its order dated 4 November 2009 declined to entertain the petition in view of an arbitration agreement contained in Clause 12.36 of the PPA.
The genesis of the matter is from when the Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board3 entered into a Power Purchase Agreement4 on 20 May 1999 with the respondent.
However we have expressed no opinion either on the merits or the 9 objections of the appellant which when urged would be considered by the appropriate forum.
However the PPA was terminated on 27 September 2001 by the Board.
Pending application if any stands disposed of.
