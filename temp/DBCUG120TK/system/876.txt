NAFRHIGH COURT OF CHHATTISGARH BILASPURCriminal Appeal No.13619Judgment Reserved on : 22.9.
Sd JUDGE Gopal.
The conviction and sentenceimposed upon the Appellant are set aside and he is acquitted of allthe charges framed against him.
18.In the result the appeal is allowed.
Thus from the entire evidenceadduced by the prosecution in this case in my considered view both demand and acceptance of bribe money are not proved.Therefore conviction of the Appellant is not sustainable.
Therefore if ondipping of the hands of the Appellant in a solution of sodiumcarbonate colour of that solution turned into pink that does not helpthe case of the prosecution.
He isentitled to get benefit of doubt.
The transcription 15(Ex.P9) does not show that at the time of trap also the Appellantmade any demand for bribe from the Complainant.
Asper the statement of Complainant Devendra Kumar Choudhary(PW1) he had kept the tainted money in the drawer of the tablewithout the knowledge of the Appellant.
