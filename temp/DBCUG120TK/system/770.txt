on 25 01 CRM M 43025 2020 1 IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB & HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH.
12.01.2021 JUDGE NOTE: Whether speaking non speaking: Speaking Whether reportable: YES NO.
1 on 25 01 CRM M 43025 2020 10 In view the discussion above the present petition is held to be not maintainable and is dismissed with costs.
CRM M 43025 2020 Date of Decision:12.01.2021 Mrs.
Costs are being imposed since precious judicial time during the Covid 19 Pandemic has been wasted on an issue which already stands decided against the petitioner on four earlier occasions.
Vijay Lata …..Petitioner Versus Sh.
Even the averment by the petitioner that her earlier CRM M 10355 2020 was dismissed due to a technical defect of legal procedure due to wrong prayer as per Section 195 of CrPC is also incorrect and false.
JUSTICE ALKA SARIN Present: Mrs.
Rajiv Arora …..Respondent CORAM: HON BLE MRS.
