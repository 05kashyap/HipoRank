The High Court cannot in guise of exercising its jurisdiction under Article 227 convert itself into a court of appeal when the Legislature has not conferred a right of appeal and made the decision of the subordinate court or tribunal final on Learned Appellate Court has considered all the three relevant factors and has recorded a finding that plaintiffs have a prima facie case and balance of convenience is also in their favour therefore learned trial Court erred in not granting temporary injunction in their favour.
