JUSTICE MANMOHAN HON BLE MR.
These circumstances do not admit of any doubt as to the entitlement of the assessee to claim the benefit under section 10(26B) and with that view of the matter we find it difficult to agree with the view of the authorities below.
We therefore set aside both the orders and direct the Learned Assessing Officer to allow the assessee to benefit of section 10(26B) of the Act.‚Äù Emphasis supplied) Since the Tribunal which is the highest fact finding authority has given a categorical finding which suffers from no perversity this Court finds no reason to interfere.
