The continuity of this marriage is fruitless and is rather causing grief and harm to both the parties.
JUSTICE JASMEET SINGH Through: Respondent in person .....Respondent JUDGMENT JASMEET SINGH J 1.

In this view of the matter we do not find ourselves inclined to grant the Appellant‟s prayer against the dissolution of marriage and find no infirmity in the impugned order dated 30.11.2019.
In the instant case not to grant a decree of divorce would be disastrous for the parties.
It is clear from a bare perusal of the matter at hand that the marriage is beyond repair.
The continuation of the marriage between the parties would cause undue harm to not only the Respondent wife but also Appellant husband.
