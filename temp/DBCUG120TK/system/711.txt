Now so far as the reliance placed upon the decision of this Court in Jai Narain Mishra and Ors Vs.
We have gone through the impugned judgment and order passed by the High Court as well as the judgment and order passed by the learned Trial Court convicting the accused for the offences under Section 307 read with Section 34 of the IPC.
The prosecution as such has examined in all 10 witnesses in support of the case of the prosecution out of which there are two injured eye witnesses PW7 and PW8.
We are in complete agreement with the view taken by the learned Trial Court as well as the High Court.
Both of them have supported the case of the prosecution.
