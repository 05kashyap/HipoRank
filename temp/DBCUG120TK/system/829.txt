IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI W.P.(C) 12551 2021 & C.M.No.39521 2021 CT GD MAHAKAR SINGH ....
Consequently the request of counsel for the petitioner for withdrawal of the present writ petition is declined and the writ petition along with pending application being bereft of merit is dismissed.
Petitioner Through Mr.Ajit Kakkar with Ms.Ria Gandhi UNION OF INDIA & ORS.
Respondents Through Mr.Vikrant N.Goyal Advocate.
The omission to deal with allegation of submission of fake educational qualification in the present case is not an innocent one but a part of the ‘strategy’ that had been adopted by the petitioner right from the time the disciplinary proceedings had commenced.
In fact this Court is of the view that the petitioner had overstayed leave deserted his post for nearly one and a half year to avoid giving any response to the allegation of submitting fake educational qualification.
