HIGH COURT OF CHHATTISGARH BILASPUR Criminal Appeal No.26199 Judgment Reserved on : 22.2.
(Arvind Singh Chandel JUDGE.
Bhopal M.P Appellant Respondent For Appellant : Dr.
The Appellant is acquitted of the charges framed against him.
The Appellant is entitled to get benefit of doubt.
Therefore in my considered view the prosecution has not been able to prove its case of demand and acceptance of bribe money against the Appellant.
The judgment of the Trial Court is set aside.
It is suspicious that the Appellant would have demanded and accepted bribe money in presence of those persons.
Consequently the appeal is allowed.
On 28.10.1988 the Complainant met with the Appellant and talked for the correction.
At that time inside the house the Appellant himself made the demand of bribe from the Complainant Complainant Baburamhas not stated anything in this regard in his Court statement.
In favour of Complainant Baburam the Tahsildar passed an order for correction in the relevant mutation record.
