Custodial interrogation of the petitioner is required for unearthing the plans hatched by the petitioner and the co accused and the way the plan was executed and also for the recovery of money.
This Court therefore is of the opinion that the petitioner is not entitled to the benefit of bail in the event of arrest.
The petitioner is evading arrest and the chances of the petitioner threatening the complainant or tampering with evidence cannot be ruled out.
