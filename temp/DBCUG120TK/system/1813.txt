This Court is of the view that if the argument of learned senior counsel for the appellant with regard to rate of interest is accepted it would promote one of the „cherished goals‟ of arbitration namely finality of arbitration awards.
Accordingly the impugned order of the learned Single Judge is modified to the extent that the appellant shall also be entitled to the same rate of interest as awarded by the Arbitrator to the respondent on the counter claim namely simple interest @ 12% per annum from 19th May 2011 till the date of award and @ 16% from the date of the award to the date of payment.
