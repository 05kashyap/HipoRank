on Judgment order uploaded on.
On the contrary applicant has framed on the basis of concocted story.
IN THE COURT OF SESSIONS FOR GR.BOMBAY AT MUMBAI BAIL APPLICATION NO.1100 OF 2021 NAVED ABID QURESHI V s The Stateof Disaster Management Act It is the case of the applicant that he has nothing to do with the alleged offence and has not committed any alleged offence.
As per BA No.1100 2021 case of the prosecution the accused and other boys were playing cricket in contravention of the guidelines issued by the State Government and such contravention attracts offences which are bailable in nature.
The complainant has not attributed any overt act to the present applicant Therefore provisions of Section 353 of IPC cannot be attracted.
The provisions of Section 143 and 147 of IPC are deliberately applied to arraign the present applicant.
Therefore I do not find it necessary at this stage to release the applicant on bail.
