In light of the Official Memorandum it was the duty of the learned District Judge to have promptly ordered a proper search to be conducted and thereafter reported the matter to this Court and as a last resort OP(C).No.1428 OF 2020 ordered the reconstruction of the records.
The learned District Judge has informed that the certified copy cannot be issued as the Will as it cannot be traced out.
By Ext P2 judgment the original petition was allowed.
The erstwhile owner had by an unregistered Willdated 4.1.1961 bequeathed the property in favour of his wife the respondent.
