I.A.021is closed.
In fine the Instant Company Appeal No.01 of 2021 is dismissed but without costs.
In fact the Application filed by the 1st Respondent ‘Financial Creditor’ in July 2019 is perfectly maintainable in Law of course well within the period of Limitation.
1.
Respondent No.2 Present : For Appellant : Mr.
Punjab National Bank Respondent No.1 Large Corporate Branch Represented by its Deputy General Manager 8 2 672 Sifi Chambers Road No.1 Banjara Hills Hyderabad 500034.
2.
Mr.T.S.N.Raja Interim Resolution Professional of Corporate Debtor No.16Shop cum Flat Huda Complex Kothapet Hyderabad 500035.
Resultantly the ‘Appeal’ fails.
As such the Contra Plea taken on behalf of the ‘Appellant’ that the Application filed by the 1st Respondent ‘Financial Creditor’ Punjab National Bank) is barred by Company Appeal(AT)(Ins) No.021 limitation is legally untenable and is rejected.
Further the writing signed by an individual as an ‘Acknowledgement’ the person acknowledging must be conscious of his liability and the commitment ought to be made in respect of that liability.
