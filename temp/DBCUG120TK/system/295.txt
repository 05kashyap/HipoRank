SANJAY KISHAN KAUL NEW DELHI AUGUST 03 2021.
The necessary orders be issued in the case of the respondent within one month from date the order.
The case of the respondent is that the appellants held up this issue over six years and the actual appointment took place only on 29.01.2003.
The High Court in the impugned order opined that the selection process of the father of the respondent was unambiguous and against the regular vacancy whereby he had submitted all the requisite documents to the Irrigation Department.
We are thus of the opinion that the course adopted by the Division Bench of the High Court is in accordance with law and the impugned order does not call for any 14.
The appeal is dismissed with costs throughout 15.
