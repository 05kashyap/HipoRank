The view taken by CAT in the impugned order is thus a reasonable and lawful view which does not qualify as perverse for this Court to interfere therewith in exercise of power of judicial review.
Though during the hearing no mention thereof was made but we may mention that application respondents for review of judgment dated 28th May 2018 of dismissal of W.P.(C) No.10543 2017 being Review Petition No.34 2019 is also pending consideration.

We as a Court would loathe to direct promotion W.P.(C) 2852 2021 of a public servant against whom prosecution and disciplinary proceedings are pending.
