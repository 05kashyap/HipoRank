IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.1725 OF 2010 IQBAL BASITH AND OTHERS N.
We therefore set aside the orders of the Trial Court and the High Court dismissing the suit and allow the DECEMBER 14 2020.
The order was set aside by this court in C.A.
The suit was initially dismissed.
Yet the appellants were wrongly denied the relief of permanent injunction.
16.
R.F.A No.116 1990 preferred by the appellants was allowed by the High Court.
On basis of the aforesaid discussion the materials and evidence on record we are of the considered opinion that the impugned orders dismissing the suit and the appeal are therefore not sustainable.
In our considered opinion the Trial Court and the High Court both posed unto themselves the wrong question venturing to decide the title of the appellants and arrived at an erroneous conclusion.
