However taking note of the aforesaid position as also the fact that a probe into such matters and any observation or finding would leave nothing for decision in the writ petition we are of the view that without entertaining such contentions at this stage and in view of W.A.No.321 the pendency of the writ petition it is only befitting to leave the entire matter to be decided in the writ petition however making it clear that the entire proceedings including the conduct of election would be subject to the result of the writ petition.
