As observed above at this juncture it would be but proper to allow the accused to prepare his defence without the shackles of confinement howbeit under strict conditions violation of which would invite cancellation of the liberty of bail granted.
Mr.
A.H.
From time to time necessity demands that some unconvicted persons should be held in custody pending trial to secure their attendance at the trial but in such cases "necessity" is the operative test.
Accordingly this application is hereby allowed and the accused is enlarged on bail on the following conditions: That he shall produce a personal bond of ₹ 30 000 only along with two solvent sureties of like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court That he shall not abscond or threaten the witnesses including the victim iii) That he shall appear in court as and when required iv) That he shall not leave the jurisdiction of India without due permission of the court.
