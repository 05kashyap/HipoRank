Since no exceptional circumstances or exceptional rarity have been demonstrated made out in the petitions or during the hearing and given the stage at which the arbitration proceedings are there is no occasion to warrant the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
A perusal of the above mentioned decisions shows that the following principles are well settled in respect of the scope of interference under Article 226 227 in challenges to orders by an arbitral tribunal including orders passed under Section 16 of the Act.
