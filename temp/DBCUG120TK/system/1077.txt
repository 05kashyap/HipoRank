Diengdoh Judge For the Petitioner Appellant(s) Mr.
Rather we find that the judgment and order is supported with cogent and justifiable reasons.
There is no doubt in the fact of the instant case that the appellant writ petitioner by her representation dated 21st January 2017 was essentially seeking to redefine the original land dimensions and the same cannot come within the meaning of permitted rectification or an additional document.
On a plain reading of the impugned judgment and order we do not notice any such infirmity or perversity.
