Such a course needs to be avoided.

To hold otherwise would mean that in case of success in the appeal endorsement made by the Trial Court on the documents in question would have to be cancelled leading to the unwarranted mutilation of the document.
Respondents HON BLE MR.
The decree for the Court would therefore be one of declaration and for a direction to the possessor of the documents to deliver the same for it to be cancelled.
The Courts would not at the time of passing of decree itself make such endorsement on the documents merely because the documents are on the record of the Court thereby making the right of the unsuccessful party to appeal against the said decree redundant.
