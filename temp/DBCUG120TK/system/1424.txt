IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.
We thus hold that the order of the High Court is not sustainable for the reasons recorded above.
ABDUL NAZEER NEW DELHI APRIL 05 2021.
Therefore the act of surrender of tenancy was for the benefit of the Joint Hindu family 38.
We have no hesitation to hold that the document was validly proved and accepted by the Wakf Board.
Consequently the present appeal is allowed.
It is one thing to say that the document is unreliable and an other to say that the document does not bind the plaintiff.
The said document could not have been said to be unreliable on the basis of the statement of the plaintiff who is not a party to such transac tion.
The order of the High Court is set aside and that of the Wakf Tribunal is restored with no order as to costs.
