Petitioner W.P.(C) No.7107 2012 W.P.(C) 7108 2012 RAJ KUMAR Through: Mr.H.R.
The writ petition is dismissed with no order as to costs.
For the aforesaid reasons I find no infirmity in the impugned Award.
....
Consequently in view of the admitted position that their services had been terminated without assigning any reason the challenge to the impugned Award has failed.
Petitioner JAHANGIR ALAM Through: None.
There is absolutely no reason to interfere with the limited relief of compensation of Rs.1 00 000 granted to the workmen.
In these circumstances there is no infirmity in the approach adopted by the learned Labour Court in drawing an adverse inference against the petitioner on account of its failure to produce the documents in its possession.
