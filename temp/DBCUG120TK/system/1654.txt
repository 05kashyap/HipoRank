And this is not so because of any interdicts from the courts in preventing these legal proceedings yet the proceedings have hardly moved.
The result is that the culpability of the first two respondents herein has not been determined thus a cloud hangs over their conduct and that is all 2.
We make it clear that all pleas as raised by Respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein would be considered by the SEBI legal or factual including but not confined to aspects of jurisdiction.
Really speaking this would not result in much of a delay considering that nothing has happened till now 41.
We clarify that were Respondent Nos.1 and 2 herein to fail in their endeavours it will not mean that those other proceedings have to start de novo and can continue from the stage where they are subject of course to the nature of directions passed afresh by SEBI.
