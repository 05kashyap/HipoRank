Jyotsna Rewal Dua JudgePetitioner is co accused along with four others in FIR No.
Therefore there is no merit in the bail petition which is dismissed at this stage reserving liberty to the petitioner to file fresh petition at an appropriate stage in accordance with law if so advised.
It cannot be said at this juncture that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that petitioner is not guilty of the offence alleged against her.
The petitioner therefore has failed to meet the requirements of Section 37 of the NDPS Act.
