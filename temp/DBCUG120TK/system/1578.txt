The application stands disposed of.
W.P.(C) 2988 2021 15.
Making of representations to Members of Parliament and PMO would not justify the delay and laches on the part of the petitioners in pursuing their legal remedies.
The cause of action if any arose in their favour in the years 2013 2015 whereas they approached the Tribunal only in 2020.
The petitioners have also failed to give a satisfactory explanation on the issue of delay and laches.
