This Court stands as a staunch PART D proponent of the freedom of the media to report court proceedings.
Reportable IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No.
For the reasons which we have indicated we dispose of the appeal in the Pending applications if any shall stand disposed.
Hence in view of the above discussion we find no substance in the prayer of the EC for restraining the media from reporting on court proceedings.
This we believe is integral to the freedom of speech and expression of those who speak of those who wish to hear and to be heard and above all in holding the judiciary accountable to the values which justify its existence as a constitutional institution.
It is trite to say that a formal opinion of a judicial institution is reflected through its judgments and orders and not its oral observations during the hearing.
Factual Background A delicate question of balancing the powers of two constitutional authorities in this appeal has raised larger issues of the freedom of speech and expression of the media the right to information of citizens and the accountability of the judiciary to the nation.
