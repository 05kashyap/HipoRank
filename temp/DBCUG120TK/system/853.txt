MARCH 26 2021 SANJEEV NARULA J RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW J FAO(OS)20 2021.
Appellant Through: Mr.
Accordingly the present appeal is dismissed in the afore noted terms.
In the event the Appellant succeeds in the arbitration proceedings the necessary orders pertaining to the amount of the bank guarantees will necessarily follow.
Pending applications stand disposed of.
Thus although the Appellant is prejudiced by the encashment but the amount is still secured.

BCCL has not assailed the Impugned Order.
Brijesh Kumar Goel and Mr.
Even otherwise we may only note that the amount of the bank guarantees in question has been ordered to be deposited before this Court and the same is subject to the outcome of the arbitration proceedings.
It is for this precise reason that we have given our anxious consideration to the Appellantâ€™s contentions to examine if indeed there is a case for the grant restraining orders.
