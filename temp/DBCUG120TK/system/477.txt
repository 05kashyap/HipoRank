IN THE HIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM THE HONOURABLE MR.
JUSTICE A.MUHAMED MUSTAQUE THE HONOURABLE MRS.
JUSTICE SOPHY THOMAS WEDNESDAY THE 22ND DAY OF DECEMBER 2021 1ST POUSHA 1943 AGAINST THE ORDER JUDGMENT IN OPGW 1139 2017 OF VI ADDITIONAL MFA NO.
The parties shall suffer their respective costs.
The District Court is directed to dispose the case as expeditiously as possible.
The District Court can proceed with the O.P for appointing guardian for the property of the minor and not for the person of the minor.
A.MUHAMED MUSTAQUE.
But with respect to the appointment of guardian of the person of the minor the District Court has no jurisdiction as it is a dispute squarely coming under explanationto Section 7(1 of the Family Courts Act.
So to that extent the proceedings of the District Court is liable to be set aside.
This appeal is allowed in part to that extent.
