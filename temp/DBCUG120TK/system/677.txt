The petitioner has made out sufficient ground for cancellation of bail granted by the Sessions Judge.
IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU DATED THIS THE 19th DAY OF APRIL 2021 THE HON BLE MR.
Therefore as argued by learned counsel for the petitioner it is not a fit case for granting anticipatory bail by the Sessions Judge.
REPRESENTED BY STATE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA BENGALURU 560 001.
Such being the case granting anticipatory bail to accused No.2 will be a hurdle to the investigation and he may influence the witnesses and cause obstruction to the Investigating Officer in conducting clear investigation.
