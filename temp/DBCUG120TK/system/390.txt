REPRESENTED BY HER FATHER ie.
NATURAL GUARDIAN RAVINDRA S.V.
Defence BSF soldiers b) arguably a small mistake is committed by the petitioner a minor daughter of the BSF soldier in describing the reserved category as ‘Ex.Defence’ in the CET application form however this Court is of a considered opinion that it is not at all a mistake inasmuch as the BSF is apparently a Defence Organisation too having been statutorily constituted under the provisions of the Border Security Force Act 1968 the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder make it abundantly clear that the servicemen of BSF function as the soldiers guarding the borders of the country therefore this aspect of the matter ought to have been adverted to by the respondent before denying a seat to the petitioner under the ‘Special Category’ regardless of the description mentioned by the candidate who is admittedly a minor and c) it hardly needs to be stated that the provisions for special preferential treatment of defence personnel and their children in the matter of education and employment have a great underlying philosophy and therefore they should be construed liberally for effectuating the purpose for which they have been made by the Central State Government too technical an approach would defeat their very purpose in any circumstance before rejecting the applications the officials having a word with the candidate and his her parents would infuse fairness in the action which is an essential element of justice more is not necessary to specify.
