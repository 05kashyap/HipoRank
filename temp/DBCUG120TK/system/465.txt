56 Indian Companies Act 1913 ss.
The Articles of Association of the Company provided that no person could remain a member of the company who was found not to be doing any transaction or business through the company.
Appeal dismissed.
The business organisation of the Company cannot be said to have been destroyed merely because the brokers who were acting as mediators in carrying out the business between the members had been discharged and their accounts settled.
But we cannot on that ground direct that the Company be wound up.
The company’s business was devised on the basis of the Companies Act 1913 as Originally enacted when there was no prohibition against a director entering into transactions with the company.
The Company could always restart the business with the assets it possessed and prosecute the objects for which it was incorporated.
It is true that because of this long drawn out litigation the Company’s business has come to a stand still.
