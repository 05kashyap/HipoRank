Now while awarding marks against these 35 marks which is the full marks Madrasah Service Commission naturally would face a problem for awarding of marks and manner of evaluation of the candidates against full marks 35 for academic qualification including professional qualification as in their own rules the full marks in this respect was 25 and the Commission has no tool for awarding marks to candidates for their academic qualification etc.
