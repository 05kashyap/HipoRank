28.
Respondent(s) 1.
It will be doing injustice to the petitioner if she is relegated to remedy of revision after having pursued this petition for more than nine years particularly when the writ petition stands admitted to hearing.
The direction restraining the respondents from causing interference into the engagement of the petitioner as Anganwadi Worker has also been sought.
For the foregoing reasons the writ petition is allowed and the impugned order passed by respondent No.2 Dy.Commissioner Baramulla is quashed and the order of engagement of petitioner as an Anganwadi Worker for Anganwadi Centre Mukdam Mohalla is 29.
In view of the aforesaid findings this is a fit case where this Court should exercise its writ jurisdiction and invoke its powers of judicial review so as to set at naught the perverse and illegal order passed by the Appellate Authority.
