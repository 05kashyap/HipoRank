Thus in the circumstances the impugned order passed by the learned Revisional Court is set aside.
as nothing limits such power of the Court under Section 482 Cr.P.C.
17.
but Sessionâ€™s Court does not have such parallel power and it cannot implead anyone except those mentioned under Section 401(2) Cr.P.C.
Respondents Through : Mr.M.S.Oberoi APP for the State.
and it is far wider than Crl.M.C.Nos.1163 2021 and 1186 2021 under Section 401(2) Cr.P.C.
However this shall not disentitle the complainant to appear before the learned Revisional Court in the pending revision petitions and to assist the learned APP for the State and or plead their case through the learned APP.
