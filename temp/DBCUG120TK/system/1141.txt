We may profitably refer to the relevant observations in this regard by this Court in Essar Steel as follows: Indeed if an "equality for all" approach recognising the rights of different classes of creditors as part of an insolvency resolution process is adopted secured financial creditors will in many cases be incentivised to vote for liquidation rather than resolution as they would have better rights if the corporate debtor was to be liquidated rather than a resolution plan being approved This would defeat the entire objective of the Code which is to first ensure that resolution of distressed assets takes place and only if the same is not possible should liquidation follow.‚Äù Viewed from any angle the submissions made on behalf of the appellant do not merit acceptance and are required to be rejected For what has been discussed hereinabove this appeal fails and 13th May 2021.
The limitation on the extent of the amount receivable by a dissenting financial creditor is innate in Section 30(2)(b) of the Code and has been further exposited in the decisions aforesaid.
