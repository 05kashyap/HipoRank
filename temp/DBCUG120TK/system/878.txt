13.Therefore I am of considered opinion that as per the MoU the petitioner wouldbe entitled to get a sum of Rs.5 Lakhs as insurance claim.
RespondentsFor Petitioner:Ms.
Trishna Das Advocate For Respondent No.1:Shri Dashrath Gupta Advocate For Respondents State:Ms.
The documentswould show that despite the State persuaded the insurance company to releasethe amount to the tune of Rs.5 Lakhs considering the injury sustained by thepetitioner and various letters having written however the insurance companyremained dormant.
The benevolent object of MoU cannot be seen in narrowlence only to avoid liability by insurance company.
The denial of the claim by 8insurance company will defeat the trust in the system & will impress upon thepeople working in naxallite operation that sword is dangling over them withoutany sense of security.
