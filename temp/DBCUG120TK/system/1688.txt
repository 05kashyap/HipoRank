In the Instant case almost more than two years have been passed and the election petition has not seen the result.
Page 6 It is reiterated that mere filing of the SLP before the Hon’ble Supreme Court as against the order of dismissal of M.C.No.220 cannot affect the proceeding of the instant election petition and moreover there is no interim order of the Hon’ble Supreme Court restraining this Court from proceeding with the main election petition.
