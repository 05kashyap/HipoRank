Dismissed.
Abhay Kumar Bhargava Adv.
Petitioner UNION OF INDIA & ORS.
As personnel of a disciplined force like the BSF the petitioner cannot absent himself without leave and such conduct is taken seriously by the respondent BSF and accordingly the punishment of dismissal has been rightly imposed.
As noted in the order dated 28th May 2021 the petitioner had absented himself without leave on earlier occasions also but was dealt with leniently and given an opportunity to improve his conduct.
Respondents Through: Ms.
The conduct of the petitioner of absenting himself without leave gravely affects the ethos and discipline of an armed force like BSF.
The petitioner has failed to provide any justification for proceeding without leave.
