JUDGE MUKTA GUPTA) JULY 06 2021 W.P.(CRL.) 798 2021.
Order be uploaded on the website of this Court.
Vide the order of the Home Department Govt.
of NCT dated 8th January 2021 all convicts released on emergency parole were directed to surrender to custody as the emergency parole was not extended further.
Petition is dismissed.
Thus the petitioner surrendered on 21st February 2021.
Thus the contention of learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner had undergone substantial sentence in default of payment of fine while on emergency parole cannot be accepted.
As per the petitioner since the notification of the Govt.
17.
The rules clearly prescribe that a convict is not entitled to remission while undergoing sentence in default of payment of fine.
16.
Prisoners sentenced in default of payment of fine x x x x x x 15.
Thus from the notification issued by the Government granting emergency parole it is evident that release was in the nature of remission as the sentence was being undergone and not mere suspension of sentence as in the case of parole.
