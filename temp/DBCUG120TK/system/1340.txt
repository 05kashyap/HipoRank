5119 … .Applicant(s) SWAROOP SEN Through : Mr.
Sanjib Dawn Advocate AJAY KUMAR BORAL AND ANOTHER Through : Mr.
The restricted and limited review is to check and protect parties from being forced to arbitrate when the matter is demonstrably “non arbitrable” and to cut off the deadwood.
This is not the stage for the court to enter into a mini trial or elaborate review so as to usurp the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal but to affirm and uphold integrity and efficacy of arbitration as an alternative dispute resolution mechanism.” For the reasons mentioned above I do not find any merit in the present application.

Manik Lal De Mr.
The court by default would refer the matter when contentions relating to non arbitrability are plainly arguable when consideration in summary proceedings would be insufficient and inconclusive when facts are contested when the party opposing arbitration adopts delaying tactics or impairs conduct of arbitration proceedings.
