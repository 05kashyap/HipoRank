JUDGE Saikat Sarma PA.
HIGH COURT OF TRIPURA Mat.
Since the learned District Judge observed that the relationship between the spouses did not dry up and there was chance of renewal of their relationship he should not have suspended their relationship by granting decree of judicial separation.
32] Resultantly the impugned judgment is set aside and the appeal is allowed.
As such he was not entitled either to a decree of divorce or judicial separation.
JUSTICE S.TALAPATRA HONâ€™BLE MR.
Appl.
29] In view of the tests laid down by the Apex Court in the judgments cited above conduct of the wife as attributed to her by her husband cannot be considered as cruelty for the purpose of divorce.
The incidents pointed out by the husband can only be considered as misunderstanding between the parties and as such we are of the considered view that the husband has failed to make out any ground of divorce in the case.
