Reportable IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal Nos 2401 24021 SLPNos.
The appeals shall stand disposed of in the above terms.
29975 299718 Sayyed Ayaz Ali Appellant Prakash G Goyal & Ors.
For the above reasons we affirm the judgment of the Single Judge of the High Court: allowing the revision application filed by the first and second defendants dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant plaintiff.
The appellant is the plaintiff in a suit instituted before the Civil Judge Senior Division at Nagpur.
Respondents Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud J These appeals arise from a judgment of a Single Judge at the Nagpur Bench of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.
In the circumstances the High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion that the further direction that was issued by the Trial Judge was not in consonance with law.
The proviso evidently covers the cases falling within the ambit of clausesandand has no application to a rejection of a plaint under Order 7 Rule 11(d).
