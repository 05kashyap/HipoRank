JUDGE This judgment is pronounced by me in terms of Rule 138of J&K High Court Rules 1999.
JUSTICE SANJAY DHAR JUDGE By this common judgment the above noted two writ petitions are proposed to be disposed of.
22 Before parting this Court would like to deprecate the practice of filing successive writ petitions for the same relief after failing to get the interim relief in the earlier writ petition(s).
It would be open for the petitioner to approach the Civil Court and agitate this aspect of the matter for obtaining appropriate relief against the respondent 21 In view of the aforesaid discussion both the writ petitions are dismissed.
The petitioner after having failed to get an interim order for release of loan instalment in earlier writ petition W.P No.379 2020 filed a second writ petition W.P.(C) No.1216 2020 for a similar relief.
Ordinarily this Court would have imposed heavy costs upon 13 WP1216 2020 c w WP(C) 379 2020 the petitioner for resorting to this unhealthy practice but having regard to the fact that the petitioner is a student a lenient view of the matter is taken and the petitioner is warned to be careful in future in such matters.
