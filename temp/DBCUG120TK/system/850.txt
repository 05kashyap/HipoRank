The petitioner and his father would do well to accept the decision of the IMA gracefully and utilize all the learning in the 2 years spent by the petitioner at the IMA to work towards a bright future in any other chosen field.
Through: Mr.
There is no doubt that the petitioner has struggled to meet the expectations of his father.
It is amply clear to us that the petitioner is not suited to a military lifestyle and possibly the desires of his father pushed him into this W.P.5622 2020 direction.
