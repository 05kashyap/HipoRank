Defendant Through Mr.
RAJIV SAHAI ENDLAW J.
The application is thoroughly misconceived and is dismissed.
It is thus quite evident that the Court had passed the decree in terms of the compromise after being fully satisfied of the lawfulness of the compromise arrived at between the parties.

HON BLE MR.
I have heard the counsel for the defendant applicant.
IA No.10043 2021& IA No.10044 2021 610 2018 so listed.
None appears for the plaintiff non applicant though the counsel for the defendant applicant on enquiry states that he had sent an advance copy.
The same would have stopped the clock from running and save the defendant applicant from CS(OS) 610 2018 further increase in prices of gold.
