IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.
The order of punishment dated 14.12.2001 is hereby restored NEW DELHI DECEMBER 8 2021.
The orders of the High Court and of the Tribunal are set aside.
The Tribunal had misapplied the basic principles of law and the High Court has thereafter wrongly confirmed the order.
Consequently the appeal is allowed.

Therefore we find that the order of removal from service cannot be said to be unfair and unjust in any manner which would warrant an interference at the hands of the Tribunal and the High Court.
