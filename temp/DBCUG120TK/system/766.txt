We therefore find no reason to interfere with the reasoning and the conclusions in the impugned judgement as no perversity or illegality has been disclosed or is evident.
The impugned judgment does record an observation that the respondent No.1 had not made full disclosure.

The respondent No.1 has not sought an injunction against the appellants and other respondents to this appeal in his personal capacity after violating terms and claiming a privilege over other violators.
