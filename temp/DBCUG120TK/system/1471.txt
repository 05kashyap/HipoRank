However designating an employee as trainee extracting regular work from him and then denying him the benefit of Gratuity Act under the pretext of such employee being a trainee would certainly defeat the object of the welfare statute.
The Gratuity Act is undoubtedly a welfare statute which only bars an apprentice from the benefit of payment of gratuity during such training period.
IN THE HIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM THE HONOURABLE MR.
A.
The Hon ble Orissa High Court W.P.(C) No.22520 has also considered similar case in the matter of Chairman cum Managing Director Orissa Mining Corpn.
Trainees give various duties during the course of the so called training and who is not deputed in a particular designated trade cannot be called as an apprentice or learner The nomenclature of the post is not of much consequence while interpreting the beneficial provisions of the welfare statute.
