MR.
The scheduling of the examination was from 6.9.2021 to 16.9.2021 and no exception can be taken on the same.
A Division Bench of this Court refused to interfere holding that the petitioner in the said writ petition had failed to establish any arbitrariness or illegality on the part of the respondents.
I find that by Ext.P5 order dated 15.6.2021 the DMA has permitted the conduct of all National and State level public exams including Sports Section Trials from the date of the order.
