JIWAN DASS MITTAR PAL YADAV Vs STATE OF HARYANA DATE OF JUDGMENT: 26 02 1999 G.B.Pattanaik M.B.Shah Both these appeals are directed against the Judgment of a learned Single Judge of Punjab & Haryana High Court in Criminal Revision No.
By the impugned Judgment the High Court has upheld the conviction and sentence against the two appellants under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code for having committed criminal breach of trust in respect of 4300 litres of diesel oil The prosecution case in nutshell is that both the accused persons were posted in the office of Government Heat Treatment Centre at Bahadurgarh and on 23.2.82 they were authorised to bring 10 000 litres of light diesel oil from the Indian Oil Corporation Delhi.
We therefore do not find any justification in interfering with the conviction and sentence passed against the accused Mittar Pal Yadav and consequently Criminal Appeal No.
