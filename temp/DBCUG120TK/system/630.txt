Before parting with this case a brief account of what transpired in the in camera proceedings needs to be stated: this court interacted with the parties and the child on several occasions hoping that long time invested might yield an amicable settlement however that did not happen the respondent wife graciously agreed to give up all allegations made against the petitioner for buying peace she also agreed to put an end to criminal cases as well and asked this court to quash them straightaway however petitioner was unjustifiably adamant and stuck to his guns though he has been happily residing with the second wife and the child begotten from her the respondent has been bringing up the child single handedly though facing the cases filed by the petitioner more is not necessary to specify.
