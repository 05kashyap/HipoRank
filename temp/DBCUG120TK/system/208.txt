IN THE HIGH COURT OF DELHI AT NEW DELHI Date of decision: 01st JUNE 2021 CRL.REV.P.
In view of the above this revision petition is not maintainable and the same is dismissed on the ground of maintainability along with the pending SUBRAMONIUM PRASAD J application.
JUNE 01 2021 CRL.REV.P.
A reading of the judgment of the Sessions Court and the grounds raised in the revision petition does not persuade this Court to call for the records of this case for further examination.

The High Court can look into the records of the case suo moto but it is equally well settled that such interference has to be used very sparingly.

No doubt Section 397 Cr.P.C gives power to the High Court to suo CRL.REV.P.
The Sessions Court has taken a view and it cannot be said that the view taken by the Sessions Court is so perverse that this Court should call for the records of the case for exercising its jurisdiction under Section 397(1) Cr.P.C.
