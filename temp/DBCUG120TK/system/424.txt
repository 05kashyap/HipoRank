REPORTABLE IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.3894 OF 2020 THE STATE OF RAJASTHAN & ORS.
SUBHASH REDDY NEW DELHI MARCH 24 2021.
The consequence is that the appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment of the Division Bench dated 16.07.2019 and learned Single Judge dated 14.05.2018 are set aside leaving the parties to bear their own costs SANJAY KISHAN KAUL R.
It seeks to give the benefit to candidates including those acquitted by the Court by giving benefit of doubt.
However such circular has to be read in the context of the judicial pronouncements and when this Court has repeatedly opined that giving benefit of doubt would not entitle candidate for appointment despite the circular the impugned decision of the competent authority dated 23.05.2017 cannot be said to suffer from infirmity as being in violation of the circular when it is in conformity with the law laid down by this Court We are thus of the view that the impugned orders cannot be sustained and the appellants are well within their rights to have issued the order dated 23.05.2017.
