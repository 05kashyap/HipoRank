The learned counsel for the respondent Nos.3 and 4 submitted on instructions while implementing the order dated 16.10.2020 the second respondent has directed the respondent Nos.3 and 4 to pay the cost of Rs.10 000.
Thus there is an inaction on the part of the official respondent for the last six years.
When the order dated 16.10.2020 is crystal clear asking the second respondent to pay the cost of Rs.10 000 it is not appropriate in directing the respondent Nos.3 and 4 to pay the cost of Rs.10 000 for no fault on their part.
