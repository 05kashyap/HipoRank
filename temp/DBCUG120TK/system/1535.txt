Appl.
115 B E F O R E HON’BLE MR.
Send down the LC records.
In the light of the above discussions we are of the view that there is no merit in the appeal.
With regard to cruelty it is seen that the respondent wife has pointed out to serious instances of cruelty against her husband which have also been supported by consistent and coherent evidence of her witnesses.
But this is not the only test of irretrievable break down of marriage.
No.
Divorce is found on fault theory.
