IN THE CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO.
With this order the case is disposed of leaving the parties to bear their [HRISHIKESH ROY SEPTEMBER 28 2021 Page 1.
Supported by our above discussion we are of the considered opinion that the High Court was in error in granting retrospective seniority to the respondent.
The appeal is accordingly allowed and the impugned orders passed by the High Court are set aside and quashed.
The father of the respondent was working as a Home guard and after he died in harness the respondent applied for compassionate appointment.
24.
Thus aggrieved the respondent moved and obtained relief from the Patna High Court for appointment in Class IV post.
15.
When the denial of analogous appointment is founded to be arbitrary and legally incorrect the benefit of notional seniority may be conferred on the deprived individual.
However the present is not a case of that category.
