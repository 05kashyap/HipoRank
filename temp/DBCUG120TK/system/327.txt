However this has nothing to do with the issue relating to the signatures of the representatives of the appellant which they do not deny.
We perceive this to be another endeavour on part of the respondent No.1 to unnecessarily keep prolonging the issue and somehow prevent encashment of the bank guarantee In view of the aforesaid we set aside the impugned order and dismiss the appeal filed by respondent No.1 before the High Court against the order of the first appellate court rejecting their application for production of additional documents.
District Judge Khurda.
On 18.11.2019 the appellate court passed an interim order restraining the release of payment of bank guarantee which order was confirmed on 19.11.2020.
