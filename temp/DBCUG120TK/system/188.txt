The present petition is thus misconceived.
VIBHU BAKHRU J JANUARY 8 2021 O.M.P.(COMM.) 88 2020.
As noticed above the question whether the disputes are arbitrable or not is a matter effecting the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal and the same is not a subject matter of Section 32(2)(c) of the Act.
The same is accordingly dismissed.
Pillai Advocate.

Through Mr Shinu J.
This decision would have little relevance in cases where the arbitral proceedings have not been terminated the arbitrators are able to perform their function and they have neither withdrawn their mandate nor has the same been terminated by the parties.
It is in that context that the Supreme Court held that ―the question whether the mandate of the arbitrator stood legally terminated or not can be examined by the court as provided under Section 14(2)‖.
The petitioners also pray that orders be passed O.M.P.(COMM.) 88 2020 terminating the arbitral proceedings.
