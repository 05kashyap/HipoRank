Dismissed with costs of Rs.30 000 AMIT BANSAL J.
Petitioner Through: Mr.
In my view the present petition is completely frivolous and misconceived.
It appears that all these grounds have been taken by the petitioner only to resile from her obligations under the agreement to sell and to delay the adjudication of the suit.
Therefore in any case the suit would have to proceed with trial.
Gaurav Singh Advocate PUSHPRAJ DALAL Through: Mr.
Rajesh Yadav Senior Advocate with Mr.
There cannot be any piecemeal rejection of a plaint under provisions of Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC.
Vikas Sharma Advocate Respondent HON BLE MR.
JUSTICE AMIT BANSAL AMIT BANSAL J.VIA VIDEO CONFERENCING] CM No.
Even if it is assumed that the relief of specific performance cannot be granted and that the agreement to sell was not valid in law the respondent has made an alternative prayer for recovery of Rs.1.95 crores towards damages.
