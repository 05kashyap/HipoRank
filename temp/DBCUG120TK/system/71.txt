The Court noticed common deficiencies which occur in the course of criminal trials and certain practices adopted by trial courts in criminal proceedings as well as in the disposal of criminal cases and causes.
These very often lead to asymmetries and hamper appreciation of evidence which in turn has a tendency of prolonging proceedings especially at the appellate stages.
These related amongst others to the manner in which documentsreferred to are presented and exhibited in the judgment and the lack of uniform practices in regard to preparation of injury reports deposition of witnesses translation of statements numbering and nomenclature of witnesses labeling of material objects etc.
