Mr.
Piyush Shah for the Petitioner.
CORAM : S.C.
The Petitioner whowas the first party to the reference opposed it.
GUPTE J.
Its case before thereference court was that the unit was closed down and in accordancewith negotiations with the representative union closure compensationwas paid to all workmen.
That does not appear to be the case here.
As the Supreme Court observed inthe case of General Labour UnionBombay vs.
The LabourCourt has in the impugned award at best only cursorily referred to theaspect of bonafides of the closure on a one line observation that “whenthe first party on 1.11.97 or thereafter at any time started its factorymanufacturing activity then this clearly proves that the closure was notbonafide.” This was followed by another startling observation by thecourt that “after restarting of the factory by the first party thetermination of these 10 employees converted into retrenchment.” TheLabour Court in other words treated the closure in its own words as“valid upto the date of restarting of the factory of the first party”.
