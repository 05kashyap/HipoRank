SANJEEV NARULA J MANMOHAN J NOVEMBER 20 2020.
In view of the foregoing we find no merit in the present appeal.
Accordingly the appeal and the applications are dismissed.
Therefore refusing to severe the matrimonial ties would cause further mental cruelty to the Respondent.
JUSTICE MANMOHAN HON BLE MR.
In view of the totality of the circumstances evident from the nature of allegations and counter allegations made by the parties and the evidence that has come on record the conclusion drawn by the Trial Court cannot be faulted with.
