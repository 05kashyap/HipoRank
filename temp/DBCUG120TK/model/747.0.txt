High Courts do not usually interfere in matters of Paramilitary transfers; however exceptions can be made only in the rarest or rare cases where there is no alternative.  A single-member bench of the High Court of Jharkhand consisting of Justice Dr. S.N. Pathak dealt with this matter in the case of Mukesh Singh C.I.F.F. No. 942294301 v The Union of India [W.P. (S) No. 1482 of 2021] on 8th June 2021. The petitioner, Mukesh Singh is working for the Central Industrial Security Force and is presently posted at the CISF Unit in Jadugoda. His wife has conceived using I.V.F. Technology at Jamshedpur where she needs to visit for regular consultation of the doctors. Her expected date of delivery is 2nd September 2021; however on 13th April 2020 he was issued a transfer order. The petitioner mentioned that he is conscious of the fact that the high court does not usually interfere with transfer orders in the CISF, however in the present scenario and special circumstances he humbly prays for the Court to stay the transfer order for three months on the grounds of the doctor’s advice that his wife needed complete bed rest and he is the only person who can look after her.  The respondents vehemently opposed the contention.
