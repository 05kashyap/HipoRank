The petitioners are at liberty to live together and any interference in their peaceful living shall not be tolerated by any person. In case of any disturbance, the petitioners are at liberty to approach the senior Superintendent of Police or the Superintendent of Police with a copy of this order for protection and the approached officer shall give them immediate protection. Such an observation was made by the Hon’ble Allahabad High court before Hon’ble Justice Mohammad Aslam in the matter of Smt. Saima &amp; ors vs  State Of U.P &amp; Anr [WRIT – C No. – 28718 of 2021].  
The crux of the matter was the petitioners were major and have solemnized their marriage according to the Muslim rites and customs on 24.01.2021 and for the same they were been threatened and harassed.

The Hon’ble High Court while allowing and deciding the writ petition held that when the petitioners are major then they are free to marry according to their own free will and there shall be no questions to that. Further, the Hon’ble High Court referred to the case of  Lata Singh vs. State of UP 2006 Cr.L.J. 3312 in which the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that “This is a free and democratic country, and once a person becomes a major he or she can marry whosoever he/she likes. If the parents of the boy or girl do not approve of such intercaste or inter-religious marriage the maximum they can do is that they can cut off social relations with the son or the daughter, but they cannot give threats or commit or instigate acts of violence and cannot harass the person who undergoes such inter-caste or inter-religious marriage.”

The Hon’ble High Court further directed the senior Superintendent of Police and the Superintendent of Police to provide immediate protection in case any threats are received by the petitioners and directed the petitioners to register their marriage according to ‘Uttar Pradesh Marriages Registration Rules, 2017’ within two months from the date of the judgment.
