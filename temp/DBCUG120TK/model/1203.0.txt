Parallel litigation refers to a scenario where different courts are hearing the same claim. Parallel litigation is not permitted as it wastes time and money of the public over meaningless litigation. Filing an FIR against someone while they have departmental proceedings against him for the same issue would constitute parallel litigation. This was adjudged by a single-member bench of Justice Ali Mohammad Magrey of the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir in the case of Dara Singh v State of Jammu and Kashmir &amp; Others [CRMC No. 36/2018] on 3rd June 2021. The petitioner, Dara Singh was working as a head constable in the Police Department and was posted with the Railway Department. The petitioner allegedly produced a fake No Objection Certificate before his department which enabled him to fraudulently obtain a car loan from Canara Bank, Budshah Chowk, Srinagar. The NOC produced by the petitioner was verified by the railway department and upon them understanding that it was not issued by the bank authorities, the petitioner was temporarily placed under suspension and departmental proceedings were initiated against him. He was reinstated back into service and additionally a First Information Report no. 58/2017 was filed under Sections 420 and 467 of the erstwhile Ranbir Penal Code for cheating and forgery. The petitioner requested the honourable High Court to quash the FIR against him on the grounds of parallel litigation since the departmental investigation against him was still going on.
