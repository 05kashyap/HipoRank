According to the petitioner, the delay in the refurbishment of the equipment was solely attributable to the petitioner and since ARB.P.930/2021 respondent failed to complete the refurbishment of the plant within 45 days of the execution of the lease agreement, the respondent has no right to demand any amount. Meanwhile, the petitioner claims that when the respondent failed to make the payments raised by the petitioner, a legal notice dated 03.03.2021 was issued to the respondent calling upon to make the payment of ARB.P.930/2021 Rs.1,97,77,000/- and notified that if the respondent fails to make the payment within 14 days of receipt of the notice. However, since the petitioner did not receive any communication from a respondent in response to its legal notice dated 03.03.2021, it has approached this Court seeking the appointment of Arbitrator. Given the above, keeping in mind that disputes inter se parties have to be resolved in terms of Article 17 of the Lease Agreement dated 09.05.2018, which is not disputed, this petition is allowed. The court perused the facts and argument’s presented, it believed that- “The fee of the learned Arbitrator shall be governed by the Fourth Schedule of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The learned Arbitrator shall ensure compliance of Section 12 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 before commencing the arbitration. The petition is accordingly disposed of”.
