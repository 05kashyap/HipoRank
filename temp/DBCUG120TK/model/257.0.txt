Learned Amicus Curiae while assailing the judgment does not contest the finding of the learned trial Court holding that the injury leading to the death of the victim was caused by the present appellant. However, the contention of the learned Amicus Curiae is that there was no intention to cause death and, as such, the ingredients of the offence of murder as defined under Section 300, Cr PC was not present. Therefore, the learned trial Court ought not to have recorded conviction under Section 302, IPC. At best, according to the learned Amicus Curiae, it was a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under Section 304 Part II, IPC. Counsel for defense is sought to be raised by the appellant to the effect that, the injury to the victim was caused accidentally and he did not have any intention to assault his wife, no evidence could be brought on record to substantiate the stand taken by the appellant.
