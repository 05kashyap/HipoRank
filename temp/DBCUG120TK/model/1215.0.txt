The rival submissions on the point were noted in the order dated 18.11.2019.Certain options about rented accommodation were given by the respondent No.1 which were not accepted by the appellant and as such while reserving the matter for orders, it was observed by this Court in its order dated 21.1.2020.No response has been filed by the respondent No.1 either disputing the market value of the apartment as stated by the appellant or traversing the submission that the appellant be granted at least Rs.65,00,000/- (sixty-five lakhs) by way of permanent settlement. In any case, the respondent No.1 had shown willingness to make over to the appellant 1/3rd value of the apartment by way of permanent settlement. This order is, therefore, premised on such willingness and the assumption that the other sharers, namely, the son and the daughter of the respondent No.1 from his first wife are also willing and agreeable to the sale of the apartment.
