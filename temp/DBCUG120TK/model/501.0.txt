Basic right to food and nutrition is an obligation on the part of government The Writ Petition No. 857 of 2015 was filed by the appellant regarding the problematic implementation of National Food Security Act, 2013 with the view that welfare legislation should be implemented. Initially the National Food Security Ordinance, 2013 was promulgated by the President on 5th July, 2013. Thereafter, the National Food Security Bill, 2013 was introduced in Parliament with, amongst others with the objectives such as establishing a multi-faceted grievance mechanism including a District Magistrate Reversal Officer, provisions for State Food Commissions, welfare schemes and so on.The National Food Security Bill was passed by both Houses of Parliament and received the assent of the President on 10th September, 2013 but the authorities and bodies mandated to be set up under the National Food Security Act, 2013 (for short ‘the NFS Act’) had not been made functional in some States even after four years. This was despite the fact that Section 14 of the NFS Act requires that “Every State Government shall put in place an internal grievance redressal mechanism.On 1st December, 2016 the learned Attorney General informed the Supreme Court that the Secretary in the Ministry of Food and Public Distribution pursuant to an order passed by us on 28th October, 2016 held a meeting on 9th November, 2016 regarding the procedures and setting up of commissions on state level.During the matter was taken up on 22nd March, 2017 the court noted that provisions of the NFS Act had not been faithfully and sincerely implemented by the State Governments before us. With regard to the implementation of Section 16 of the NFS Act it observed that the State Food Commission had not yet been appointed. The court noted that many State Governments had appointed the Consumer Redressal Commission constituted under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 as the State Food Commission.Still, many of the states had not implemented the commission which was the background of the present writ petition. ISSUE BEFORE THE COURT:What can the Government of India do to require the State Governments and Union Territories to make functional those bodies and authorities that are mandated by a law passed by Parliament (such as the National Food Security Act, 2013)?What remedy does a citizen of India have if the Government of India does not issue such a direction and the State Government or the Union Territory does not implement a law passed by Parliament? RATIO OF THE COURT:The court observed that Model Rules circulated by the Central Government needed serious considerations by the State Governments involved as by other State Governments and Union Territories. It also opined that the Central Government, the grievance redressal machinery should be independent and its functioning should be transparent. As long as this is achieved, it hardly matters that some officer of the government is appointed as the District Grievance Redressal Officer.In the court’s view it was appropriate if an officer dealing with delivery of entitlements under the NFS Act was not appointed or designated as the District Grievance Redressal Officer since he or she might not be able to entertain a complaint against his or her own functioning. The court found it very apathetic on the part of the governments that many of the State Governments have not yet established a working State Food Commission, this is a clear indication that there is hardly any commitment to the implementation of the NFS Act.The court referred to the letter dated 14th March, 2017 where it had been mentioned that the States and Union Territories intending to designate any existing statutory commission to function as the State Food Commission should ensure that the provisions of Section 16 of the NFS Act are complied with. The court opined that while it was theoretically possible to have a statutory commission or body function as a State Food Commission, provided that statutory commission or body is constituted and established in accordance with the provisions of Section 16 of the NFS Act, there might be several practical difficulties in the actual working of one statutory commission performing two disparate functions under two different statutes.This could compromise the efficiency of that statutory commission or body with the result that the beneficiaries of the multifarious functions of the statutory commission or body would suffer at both ends. This in turn would reduce the importance of a basic right to wholesome and nutritious food particularly for women and children which was really the objective of the NFS Act.The court held that importance of the State Food Commission cannot be minimized by the State Government if the NFS Act is to be faithfully implemented. It also observed by a reading of affidavit filed by the Haryana govt. that there was hardly any work for state commissions and stated that this attitude would defeat the whole purpose of the Act.The court referred to the draft Report of the Working Group on Developing Social Audit Standards which had been accepted by the Central govt. and the CAG and audits according to which were being carried out and held that requirement of a social audit is undoubtedly salutary and since it had been accepted by the Central Government as well as by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, there was no reason why it should not be put in place in so far as the NFS Act is concerned, particularly since a social audit is mandated Under Section 28 of the NFS Act.The court also put the responsibility on the states for not appointing Vigilance Commissions. It also held that it was not necessary to appoint any Food Commissioner or Ombudsman to oversee the functioning and implementation of the NFS Act since it was more important that each State Government and Union Territory realize and appreciate their statutory and constitutional obligations and ensure that the will of Parliament which enacted the National Food Security Act, 2013 was given full effect to in letter and spirit.It concluded that the NFS Act had clearly not been implemented by some states and issued directions accordingly. DECISION HELD BY COURT:The Secretary in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution of the Government of India should convene one or more meetings on or before 31st August, 2017 of the concerned Secretaries of all the State Governments and Union Territories to take stock of the implementation of the NFS Act and brainstorm over finding ways and means to effectively implement the provisions of the NFS Act in letter and spirit. A law enacted by Parliament as a part of its social justice obligation must be given its due respect and must be implemented faithfully and sincerely and positively before the end of this year.The Secretary in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution of the Government of India should emphatically request and commend to every State Government and Union Territory to notify appropriate Rules for a Grievance Redressal Mechanism under the provisions of the NFS Act and designate appropriate and independent officials as the District Grievance Redressal Officer within a fixed time frame and in any case within this year. Adequate publicity should be given to the appointment and designation of District Grievance Redressal Officers so that any aggrieved person can approach them without any fear and with the expectation that the grievance will be redressed.The Secretary in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution of the Government of India will emphatically request and commend to the State Governments and Union Territories to constitute, establish and make fully functional a State Food Commission under the provisions of the NFS Act before the end of the year. The NFS Act specifies a very large number of functions that a State Food Commission is required to perform-there is no dearth of work for the State Food Commission. Therefore the said Secretary should require the Chief Secretary to ensure that adequate arrangements are made by each State Government and Union Territory to provide adequate infrastructure, staff and other facilities for the meaningful functioning of the State Food Commission including preparation of annual reports required to be laid before the State Legislature. In our opinion, it would not be appropriate for reasons that we have already indicated to appoint another statutory commission or body to function as the State Food Commission unless it is absolutely necessary and completely unavoidable and only as a last resort. The Secretary in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution of the Government of India will emphatically commend and request every State Government and Union Territory to constitute and establish a functioning Vigilance Committee in terms of Section 29 of the NFS Act before the end of the year for the purposes of carrying out the duties and responsibilities mentioned in that Section.The Secretary in the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution of the Government of India will ensure that the social audit machinery postulated by Section 28 of the NFS Act and which is already in place in so far as the MGNREG Act is concerned is established at the earliest with appropriate modifications to enable every State Government and Union Territory so that a periodic social audit is conducted and the NFS Act is purposefully implemented for the benefit of the people. MINORITY DISSENT:Hon’ble Justice N.V Ramana in his dissenting opinion stated that the pathetic implementation of the NFS Act was a result of discrepancies on several levels and opined that the problem required a coordination between both the Central and the state governments. He stated that the Union govt. had full powers to Act accordingly in the matter and further opined that a balance is needed to be struck between the Central and the State levels in order to bolster the ethos of federalism as well for which he relied upon Jindal Stainless Steel v. State of Haryana AIR 2016 SC 5617.
