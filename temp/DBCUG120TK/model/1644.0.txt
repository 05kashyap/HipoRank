The approach of the Court in dealing with evidences must be of such nature that it does not result in grave miscarriage of justice. The High Court ought to be careful and vigilant while dealing with the offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act as they are the offences against the society. This assertion was made by the Honorable Supreme Court of India by a three judge bench of J. Ashok Bhushan, J. Subhash Reddy and J. M.R. Shah in the case of State of Gujarat vs. Bhalchandra Laxmishankar Dave [CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.99 OF 2021]. In the instant case, High Court of Gujarat in a Criminal Appeal acquitted the respondent herein original accused for the offences under Section 7 r/w Sections 13(1) &amp; 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act by quashing and setting aside the judgment and order of conviction passed by the Learned Special Judge, Bharuch, Gujarat has preferred the present appeal. The respondent herein original accused who was an Assistant Director in ITI, Gandhi Nagar was charged for the offences. The Special Judge held the accused guilty and convicted the accused for the aforesaid offences and imposed the sentence of 5 years imprisonment and with fine. Feeling aggrieved with the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by the Learned Special Judge, the accused preferred appeal before the High Court.  By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court without any detailed re-appreciation of the entire evidence on record, acquitted the accused.
