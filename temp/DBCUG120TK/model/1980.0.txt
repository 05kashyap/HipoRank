The slight difference in the nature of services and a slightly higher percentage of risk due to the proximity of the client and the service provider can be obviated by prescribing stricter measures and safeguards. Such preventive measures must be adopted rather than continuing to keep the establishments closed. This was contended by the Delhi High Court, in the case Ms. Sukaita and othrs. vs. Government of NCT of Delhi and Anr. [W.P.(C)6555/2020] and Association of Wellness Ayurveda and Spa vs. Government of NCT of Delhi [W.P.(C)7366/2020], presided by J. Pratibha M. Singh. In the present case, the Petitioners are technical workers who have been trained under various national bodies and run spas in Delhi. In effect, the grievance of the Petitioners is that, after the lockdown in March 2020, though various other establishments have been permitted to reopen and commence businesses, spas have still been forced to remain closed. The Petitioner is also aggrieved by the delay by GNCTD and the Ministry of Home Affairs in issuing guidelines for re-opening of spas. Accordingly, the Court permitted the reopening of spas, wellness clinics and similar establishments, in the GNCTD, by laying specific guidelines to be followed and strict measures to be taken.
