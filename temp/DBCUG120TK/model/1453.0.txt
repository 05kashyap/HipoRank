The Board of Councilors is the competent authority under Section 217 of the Act, to decide any dispute on the issue of misrepresentation or fraudulent statement in the application seeking sanction of building plan, for the purpose of passing an appropriate order to cancel such sanction. The aforesaid has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of India while adjudicating the case of Debabrata Saha v. Serampore Municipality &amp; Ors. [Civil Appeal No. 3657 of 2010] which was decided by a single judge bench comprising Justice Nageswara Rao on 1st September 2021. The facts of the case are as follows. Appellant had purchased the ground floor of the property in dispute. The conveyance relates to the ground floor of the two-storied building admeasuring a covered area of 950 square feet. The Appellant was permitted to use the common stair case, septic tank, open yard, separate water reservoir in common portion common passages, common drain in the ground floor along with roof right. The dispute pertains to the right of Respondent No.3 in making a construction on the roof of the first floor in which he resides.
