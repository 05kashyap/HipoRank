Where any person is added as defendant under Order I Rule 10(5) CPC,, the proceedings shall be deemed to have begun against the supplemental party only from the date of service of summons on him. The commission report and plan prepared, before the petitioner, being brought in the party array, cannot legally bind her at all. This assertion was made by the Kerala High Court presided by J. T.V.ANILKUMAR in the case of SHARJA vs. SASIDHARAN &amp; anr. [OP(C).No.1037 OF 2020]. The fourth defendant in O.S.No.12/2014 was aggrieved by order dated 16.03.2020, by which the learned Munsiff, Attingal, dismissed her application seeking appointment of Commissioner to survey and measure out the suit and counter claim properties in accordance with title deeds and revenue records. The plaintiffs opposed the application contending that there is already a commission report and plan in which the matters in dispute have already been ascertained and recorded, and hence a re-issue of commission was not in accordance with law. Accepting the objection raised by the plaintiffs, I.A.No.2/2020 filed by the petitioner was dismissed.
