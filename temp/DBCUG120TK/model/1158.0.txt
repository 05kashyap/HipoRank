Question of forgery, fraud and tampering require sufficient evidence and are not capable for summary adjudication under Article 226 of the Constitution. The Delhi High Court presided over by J. P. Jalan in the case of Gaurav Jaiswal through his legal guardian Vs. Union of India &amp; Anr., [W.P.(C) 6838/2020]. The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner is an Indian Institute of Technology (“IIT”) aspirant and had appeared for the and appeared for the Joint Entrance Examinations (“JEE”) Mains conducted by the National Testing Agency (“NTA”) in January 2020 and September 2020. The Petitioner contended that the JEE (Main) final marksheet released in September 2020 wrongly included his percentile he attained in the examination conducted in the month of January 2020. The petitioner annexed the print-out of his scoresheet which included his marks of January 2020 and stated is percentile as 9808102888. But the in second edition of JEE Mains in September 2020, the combined scoresheet contained a reduced percentile of 51.8105888. The NTA opposed the petition stating that the scoresheet attached in the petition was a forged one and produced the actual copy of the scoresheet in which the Petitioner had obtained a percentile of 51.8105888, this was verified and supported by the National Informatics Centre. Further, the NTA stated that if the Petitioner obtained a 98 percentile in his January 2020 examination’s he would have been assured of his eligibility in JEE (Advance) and he would have not tried his luck again in September 2020 examination. The Court dismissed the petition on the grounds that the Petitioner had not downloaded and submitted the January’s OMR sheet and on the basis of this it is not possible for the Petitioner to prove the NTA’s stand incorrect. Hence the court stated that, “I am of the view that this is a matter entirely dependent on an adjudication of disputed questions of fact and unsuitable for determination in writ proceedings.”
