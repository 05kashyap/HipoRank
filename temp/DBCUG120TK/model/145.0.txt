The Hon’ble High court of Orissa in Mahasweta Biswal V. State of Odisha &amp; Anr. (BLAPL No. 893 of 2020) held that the provisions of Odisha Protection of Interests of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, 2011 will not apply to real estate transactions. It was observed by the court that “It is (Odisha Protection of Interests of Depositors (in Financial Establishments) Act, 2011), in essence, is a social protection enactment and its application to real estate transactions, will lead to absurd and unintended consequences. It is thus concluded that it was never the intention of the legislature to apply the provisions of the Act to neat real estate transactions and the application of the Act thereto will lead to absurd situations contrary to the legislative intendment. The instant case is a classic example of a transaction gone awry which has been strenuously given the color of a criminal offence.”
