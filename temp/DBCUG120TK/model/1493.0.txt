Being prima facie unimpressed with the maintainability of the case, the case was dismissed on the grounds of being outside the territorial jurisdiction of the court. The aforementioned was the adjudication made by the Delhi High Court in the case of Food Corporation of India Shramik Union v. Union of India [W.P. (C) 5930/2021 &amp; CMs No. 18703-04/2021] which was decided by a single judge bench comprising Justice Navin Chawla on 14th June 2021. The facts of the case are as follows. The petitioner challenged the transfer of departmental labourers posted at FSD Narayanpur Anant (NRPA), Muzaffarpur (Bihar) and labourers posted at ARDC Jamui-Bihar, as also the E-tender dated 19.05.2021 issued by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), Regional Office, Patna. The petitioners prayed before this court to issue a writ of mandamus, certiorari and/or any other appropriate writ or directions thereby prohibiting the respondents from proceeding with such a transfer. On the query made to the learned counsel for the petitioner that as the cause of action pleaded by the petitioner has arisen in Patna, this Court would lack territorial jurisdiction for entertaining the present petition, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the impugned action had been taken by the respondents pursuant to the Guidelines dated 12.07.2016 issued by the FCI and the challenge thereto is pending adjudication before this Court. He further submitted that a similar petition challenging the transfer of labourers posted at Assam has been entertained by this Court in W.P. (C) 5449/2021, titled FCI Handling Workers Union v. Union of India &amp; Anr.
