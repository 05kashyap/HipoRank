The Partition Deed contained an agreement that both the brothers should pay an amount of INR 500 each to their sister, that is, the principal respondent, inside one year of the Partition Deed, bombing which the primary respondent was permitted to recuperate it, for which reason, the said sums would stand charged on the separate properties of the appellant and the subsequent respondent. While the primary respondent acknowledged the installment from the subsequent respondent, she would not acknowledge installment from the appellant because of her own reasons, because of which the property assigned to him under the Partition Deed (Appellant’s Property) was as yet troubled with this commitment.  The appellant had moved to the District Court, Ernakulam (District Court) under Section 57 for affecting the deal liberated from encumbrance. The District Court refused the appellant’s supplication for release of encumbrance on the Appellant’s Property holding it to be not viable.
