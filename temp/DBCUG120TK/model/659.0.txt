The execution and authentication of power of attorney, having not been proved, adversely affects the sale deed. If there is no clarity in the authentication of such delegation of rights, it adversely affects the sales deed further made and questions the title over the suit property. This proclamation was made by the Supreme Court of India presided by J. Ashok Bhushan, J. M. R. Shah and J. R. Subhash Reddy in the case of A. Subramaniam &amp; anr. vs. R. Pannerselvam [CIVIL APPEAL NO.9472 of 2010].  The plaintiff, who was the respondent in this appeal, filed in 2002 in the Court of District Munsif, Namakkal praying for permanent injunction interdicting the defendants from disturbing the peaceful possession and enjoyment of the plaintiff over the suit property. The plaintiff claimed to have purchased the suit property by registered deed for a valid consideration from the descendants of Defendant. The defendants claimed that Dhasi Naiduâ€™s son Sanjeevi Naidu had entrusted the suit property and other properties to one by a registered power of attorney, who later died, leaving behind his only legal heir, who died leaving behind her two daughters. Defendant on behalf of her three daughters filed a suit against the Ghani Sahib questioning his tenancy which suit was dismissed and had been taken in appeal. The trial court held that POA was prepared at Sri Lanka and registered at Namakkal and held that the plaintiff has right over the property. The First Appellate Court came to a conclusion that power deed written abroad need not be registered and that execution and authentication of power of attorney, Exhibit PW1 having not been proved, the sale deed Exhibit was also adversely affected. Hence, plaintiff failed to establish his title over the suit property. Aggrieved by the judgment of the First Appellate Court the plaintiff filed the second appeal.
