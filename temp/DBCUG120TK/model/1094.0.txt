Petitioner’s first application for compassionate appointment was rejected, and that decision was not appealed; as a result, his second application could not be made because his first application had already been rejected on the merits by order is upheld by the High Court of Chhattisgarh through the learned bench led by Hon’ble Shri Justice Sanjay K. Agrawal in the case of Satish Rangari Vs. State Of Chhattisgarh (WP(S) 1242 of 2016). Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner’s father died on 5.2.2000, and the petitioner’s first application for compassionate appointment was rejected on 1.8.2013 , an order that the petitioner has not challenged and that has become final. When the petitioner became major in 2006, he filed an application for compassionate appointment on 19.8.2006, which was processed, but the District Education Officer, Jagdalpur, by order dated 1.8.2013  rejected the application, holding that it was filed after 8 years from the date of his father’s death, and that order was not challenged. So, the petitioner’s second application dated 17.6.2014 could not have been filed because his earlier application had already been rejected on merits by a judge. The court also stated that even if the petitioner had been present for the past 21 years after his father’s death, giving compassionate appointment to the petitioner would serve no meaningful purpose. As a result, court find no illegality or perversity in the order dismissing the petitioner’s compassionate appointment application. As a result, the writ petition, which lacks merit, is liable to be rejected and is accordingly dismissed, leaving the parties to bear their own costs.
