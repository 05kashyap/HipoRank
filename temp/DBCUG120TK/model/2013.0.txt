But no specific allegations as to how other relatives of appellant No.14 who reside in Rajasthan and Gujarat have caused the acts of domestic violence.The court also stated that it is not know as to how other relatives who are residents of Gujarat and Rajasthan can be held responsible for award of monetary relief to the respondent. Since there were no specific facts showing how the relative were responsible, there cannot exists a prima facie case against appellant 3 to 13.With respect to the jurisdiction of the Additional Magistrate at Bengaluru, the court criticized the appellant’s contention that that neither the marriage of the parties was solemnized at Bengaluru nor the matrimonial house was at Bengaluru and therefore, the Magistrate Court at Bengaluru has no jurisdiction to entertain the petition.
