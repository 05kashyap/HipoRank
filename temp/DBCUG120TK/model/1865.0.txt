Electricity is becoming a very important part of human life, especially now in the age of technology. Therefore no person has the right to prevent another from having access to electricity. This was held in the judgement passed by a single member bench of the High Court of Uttarakhand consisting of Justice Manoj Kumar Tiwari in the case of Chandan Singh v State of Uttarakhand [Writ Petition (M/S) No. 350 of 2021] on 11th June 2021. Chandan Singh, the petitioner sought relief from the High Court due to Uttarakhand Power Corporation stopping the electricity connection to his tube-well. Uttarakhand High Court explained they were not in a position to give in to the petitioner’s requests due to objections from the petitioner’s neighbor and aunt who is respondent no: 4 in this case. There exists property and familial disputes between the petitioner and respondent no: 4 and the latter objected to restoring electricity to the petitioner’s tube-well on grounds that the any electricity line would have to pass through her property and would damage her fruit bearing jamun trees. The petitioner’s counsel pointed out that using insulated wire would prevent any damage to respondent’s no: 4’s trees and alternatively that any branches touching the wires could be lopped without affecting the trees. The Court found that the respondents did not have the right to deny electricity to the petitioner’s tube well and the writ petition therefore allowed. Additionally the Joint-magistrate was instructed to ensure that no disturbance is caused while restoring the electricity connection.
