The Hon’ble judge, Mr. Justice Sanjeev Kumar decreed, “It is trite that where complicated disputed questions of fact are involved, the determination whereof requires evidence to be led before the prescribed Statutory Authority, it is not prudent to exercise extraordinary jurisdiction. The allegations of misrepresentation and fraud are, admittedly, subtle questions of fact, the determination whereof needs evidence of impeccable character. The determination of such facts and disputes can be better done by the authority concerned” in Dr. Suresh Sharma V. Union Territory of J&amp;K &amp; Ors. [WP(C) No.1100/2021 CM No.4498/2021]. The brief facts of the case are, respondent 3 and 4 are medical officers at the ISM department since 2001 and 2000 respectively. Respondent 3 applied for the RBA category certificate in 2006 and was duly issued to him. Without surrendering such a certificate, the respondent 3 got issued a fresh RBA category certificate in 2008. The same was for respondent 4. The petitioner assailed the validity and sustainability of these RBA certificates through this writ petition filed before the High Court since he feels that that respondent No.3 and 4 have, by concealment of material facts and by playing fraud have obtained category certificates and on the basis thereof have succeeded in getting accelerated promotion.
