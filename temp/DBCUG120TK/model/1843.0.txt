The High Court bench consisting of J. Vibhu Bakhru elaborated upon the object of Order 38 Rule 5 of CPC in the matter of Beigh Construction Company Private Limited v. Varaha Infra Limited [O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 372/2020 &amp; I.A. 207/2021]. The respondent was awarded a contract for executing an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Contract (EPC Contract) by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). The present petition arose out of a dispute arising between the parties in connection with a Memorandum of Understanding whereby the respondents had agreed to sub-contract the execution of the EPC to the petitioner. In terms of the Agreement, it was agreed that the petitioner would execute the EPC Contract and the entire amount received from the employer (MSDRC) would be deposited in an escrow account. The petitioner would be entitled to 99% and the respondent would be entitled to 1%. The petitioner’s grievance was that the terms of the Agreement were not being complied with and that the petitioner had not received 99% of the amount disbursed by the MASDRC. The petitioner alleged that the respondent had illegally and in breach of its obligations, retained substantial portion of the same. The learned counsel for the respondent argued that the  agreement  was terminated and this was also communicated the MSDRC. The counsel referred to a letter issued by MSRDC alleging that the progress of the works was slow and was being done in a haphazard and unplanned manner. The counsel for the petitioner countered that the petitioner was seeking its share for work executed before the termination of the contract and not after.
