“It is the duty of the Courts to first resort to the mechanism in appointment of an arbitrator as per the terms of contract as agreed by the parties” The work for construction of office accommodation for officer and rest house was allotted to the respondent contractor, at Dungarpur in the State of Rajasthan on 21st December, 2011. As alleged, the extension was granted by the appellants to complete the work by 31st March, 2013. The measurement was accepted by the respondent under protest and when appellants officials failed to clear 7th final bill until the respondent put a line over “under protest” and signed no claim certificate.The total value of the work executed was of Rs. 58.60 lakhs against which Rs. 55.54 lakhs was paid and escalation cost was not added with interest @ 18% over delay payment. Demand notice was sent to the appellants to appoint an arbitrator invoking Clause 64(3) of the GCC to resolve the disputes/differences on 23rd December, 2013.When the appellants failed to appoint the arbitrator in terms of Clause 64(3), application came to be filed under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 before the Chief Justice/his Designate for appointment of an independent arbitrator who after hearing the parties under the impugned judgment allowed the application of the respondent and appointed a retired judge of the High Court as an independent arbitrator to arbitrate the proceedings.The orders were placed for various nature of construction works for its execution and the agreement executed between the parties includes a separate chapter for settlement of disputes leaving any dispute or difference between the parties to be resolved through the process of arbitration by appointing an arbitrator invoking clause 64(3) of the contract.As per terms of the agreement, date of completion of the project was delayed as alleged due to breach of obligations by the appellants and the scheduled date of completion had to be extended. Meanwhile, due to rise in the prices of raw material, the project was impossible to be completed by the respondent contractors and hence correspondence was made to either pay the escalated price or in the absence, the respondents would not be in a position to conclude the contract. It was alleged that the appellants accepted the terms and conditions for escalated prices and asked the respondents to complete the work and handover the project.But when the respondents raised the final bills in the pre-determined format (which also included the no dues certificate) on the newly agreed prices, dispute has arisen in context of payment of escalated prices or withholding of security deposits, taking note of the existence of arbitration clause in the agreement the respondents sent a notice to appoint an arbitrator as per clause 64(3) of GCC to resolve the dispute of payment of outstanding dues which was declined by the appellants by sending the reply that “No Due Certificate” was signed and that entails no dispute to be sent to arbitration.Since the appellants failed to appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the arbitration clause in the agreement, each of the respondent filed application under Section 11(6) of the Act before the High Court for appointment of an independent arbitrator and the primary objection of the appellants before the High Court was that on furnishing the no claim certificate by the contractor, no dispute subsists which is to be sent to the arbitrator and further the claims which has been submitted were beyond time as prescribed in the agreement and thus falls under the ‘excepted matter’ in the agreementAfter the matter being heard, the application for appointment of arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996 came to be decided by the High Court of Rajasthan by separate order(s) keeping in view the independence and neutrality of arbitrator as envisaged under Section 12(5) of the Amendment Act, 2015. The High Court further observed that the amended provisions of Act, 2015 shall apply to the pending proceedings and mere furnishing of no claim certificate would not take away the right of the parties and it is open for adjudication before the arbitrator and appointed a retired Judge of the High Court as an independent sole arbitrator under the impugned judgment in exercise of power under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996. Indisputedly, the request for the dispute to be referred to arbitration in the instant batch of appeals was received by the appellants much before the Amendment Act, 2015 came into force (i.e., 23rd October, 2015). ISSUE BEFORE THE COURT:Whether the High Court was justified in invoking amended provision which has been introduced by Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment Act), 2015 with effect from 23 rd October, 2015?Whether the arbitration agreement stands discharged on acceptance of the amount and signing no claim/discharge certificate?Whether it was permissible for the High Court under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996(prior to the Amendment Act, 2015) to appoint third party or an independent Arbitrator when the parties have mutually agreed for the procedure vis-à-vis the authority to appoint the designated arbitrator? RATIO OF THE COURTAccording  to the appellants, error had been committed by invoking Section 12(5) of the Amendment Act, 2015 for appointment of an independent arbitrator without resorting to the clause 64(3) of GCC as agreed by the parties and that it was required in the first instance to make every possible attempt to respect the agreement agreed upon by the parties in appointing an arbitrator to settle the disputes/differences and only when there are allegations of bias or malafide, or the appointed arbitrator has miserably failed to discharge its obligation in submitting the award, the Court is required to examine those aspects and to record a finding as to whether there is any requirement in default to appoint an independent arbitrator invoking Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996.As submitted by respondents, once the appellants have failed to appoint an arbitrator under the terms of agreement before the application under Section 11(6) being filed before the Court, the authority forfeits its right of appointing an arbitrator and it is for the Chief Justice/his designate to appoint an independent arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act, 1996.This court noted that when the request of the respondent contractors was rejected by the appellants on the premise of the no claim certificate being furnished, arbitral dispute does not survive which is to be sent to arbitration, each of the respondent contractor approached the High Court by filing an application under Section 11(6) of the Act for appointment of an arbitrator for settling their disputes/differences arising from the terms of contract as agreed between the parties.This court held that the conjoint reading of Section 21 of the Arbitration Act 2015 read with Section 26 of the Act leaves no manner of doubt that the provisions of the Amendment Act, 2015 shall not apply to such of the arbitral proceedings which has commenced in terms of the provisions of Section 21 of the Principal Act unless the parties otherwise agree.The court further held that Clause (c) of sub-section (6) of Section 11 relates to failure to perform any function entrusted to a person including an institution and also failure to act under the procedure agreed upon by the parties.In other words, clause(a) refers to the party failing to act as required under that procedure; clause(b) refers to the agreement where the parties fails to reach to an agreement expected of them under that procedure and clause (c ) relates to a person which may not be a party to the agreement but has given his consent to the agreement and what further transpires is that before any other alternative is resorted to, agreed procedure has to be given its precedence and the terms of the agreement has to be given its due effect as agreed by the parties to the extent possible.The corrective measures have to be taken first and the Court is the last resort. It is also to be noticed that by appointing an arbitrator in terms of sub-section (8) of Section 11 of Act, 1996, due regard has to be given to the qualification required for the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties and also the other considerations such as to secure an independent and impartial arbitrator. To fulfil the object with terms and conditions which are cumulative in nature, it is advisable for the Court to ensure that the remedy provided as agreed between the parties in terms of the contract is first exhausted.The court put emphasis to act on the agreed terms and to first resort to the procedure as prescribed and open for the parties to the agreement to settle differences/disputes arising under the terms of the contract through appointment of a designated arbitrator although the name in the arbitration agreement is not mandatory or must but emphasis should always be on the terms of the arbitration agreement to be adhered to or given effect as closely as possible.The court further added that where the impartiality of the arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement is in doubt or where the Arbitral Tribunal appointed in terms of the arbitration agreement has not functioned, or has failed to conclude the proceedings or to pass an award without assigning any reason and it became necessary to make a fresh appointment, Chief Justice or his designate in the given circumstances after assigning cogent reasons in appropriate cases may resort to an alternative arrangement to give effect to the appointment of independent arbitrator under Section 11(6) of the Act.To conclude, the court held that, the High Court was not justified in appointing an independent arbitrator without resorting to the procedure for appointment of an arbitrator which has been prescribed under clause 64(3) of the contract under the inbuilt mechanism as agreed by the parties. DECISION HELD BY COURT:The High Court decision was set aside. The appellants were directed to appoint the arbitrator in terms of clause 64(3) of the agreement within a period of one month from date of judgement under intimation to each of the respondents/contractors and the statement of claim be furnished by each of the respondents within four weeks thereafter and the arbitrator may decide the claim after affording opportunity of hearing to the parties expeditiously without being influenced/inhibited by the observations made independently in accordance with law.
