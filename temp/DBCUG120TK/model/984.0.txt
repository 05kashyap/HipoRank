Exclusion of a married daughter from the ambit of expression of “family” as defined under Rule 2(c) of the Rules is illegal and unconstitutional. Therefore, the appointment of a married daughter on a compassionate basis is not illegal. Such an opinion was held by the Hon’ble Allahabad High Court before Hon’ble Chief Justice RAJESH BINDAL &amp; Hon’ble Justice PIYUSH AGRAWAL in the matter of State of U.P. through Secretary Ministry of Labour and ors vs Pooja Singh [Writ-A No. 42491 of 2017].

While the pendency of such application she got married on 01.12.2001. It was the contention of the plaintiff that the respondent has knowingly concealed the fact that she is married. 

The Hon’ble High Court referred to the judgment given in the case of Smt. Vimla Srivastava Vs. The State Of U.P. And Another 2016(1) ADJ 21 (DB) wherein the Hon’ble court held that “This Court held that exclusion of married daughter from the ambit of expression of “family” as defined under Rule 2(c) of the Rules is illegal and unconstitutional, hence was struck down.”
