The victim tried to shift the entire blame on the Appellant as the perpetrator of the crime, to save her reputation among her family members and the society. The Orissa High Court acquitted the Appellant in a 30-year old case of attempt to rape. This ratio was laid down by J. S.K. Sahoo in the case of Sarughana Nag Vs. State of Odisha, [CRA No. 128 of 1990]. The brief facts of this case are that the victim’s brother allegedly caught the accused forcing himself on his sister while she was calling for help. As per the statement of the victim and few other witnesses the accused broke into the victim’s house at night, entered her room, disrobed her and made an attempt to rape her while she cried for help. The victim’s brother found the accused and her sister in a compromised position and so he assaulted the victim with firewood. Later, an FIR was filed against the accused and he was arrested. The trial court in this case convicted the accused under section 376/51, 354 &amp; 457 of IPC and sentenced him 4 years of rigorous imprisonment. The Accused aggrieved by the Trial Court’s decision filed an appeal in the High Court. The Appellant contended that a false accusation was brought by the victim and her family as the victim had consented to sexual intercourse. Further, there was no allegation of rape in the initial report and no medical evidence to prove the allegation of rape.
